Description of the dataset:
The government of Uganda rolled out a school feeding program in selected districts to
provide primary school pupils with a free meal on school days with the hope of increasing
attendance rates in public primary schools. Schools in each district were randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups. Your task is to assess the impact of the
programme on school attendance. The Excel workbook contains two worksheets; one
with the data on attendance and the other contains the district names. Each row of data
contains data for each school within the district.
